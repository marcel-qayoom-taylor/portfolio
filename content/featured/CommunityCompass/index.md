Community Compass is a web application that helps residents find local resources and events in their community. I was the project and technical lead for Community Compass managing seven other engineers and delivered it in twelve weeks to the [United Harris Community Centre](https://www.uniting.org/community-impact/harris-community-centre) from design to deployment.
